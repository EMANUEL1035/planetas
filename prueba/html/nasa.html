            <p class="texto_1">It is undoubtedly an emblematic agency of space exploration, and it was born in a very different context than the one we know today. At first, it was founded to compete with the USSR, then at the forefront in the field of space, NASA managed in just a decade to overtake all the advances of the Soviets in this field. After achieving the feat of landing man on the Moon, it was then able to renew its projects and offer increasingly diverse and ambitious missions. Science in general owes it much of the current knowledge about the Universe and the solar system, but it is also the agency responsible for important technological advances that we can find even in our daily lives.</p>
            <p class="texto_1">Among NASA's most emblematic successes are undoubtedly the Apollo program, which made possible Neil Armstrong's first steps on the Moon, the Curiosity rover, which has been exploring the surface of the planet Mars since 2012, and the famous Hubble telescopes and its successor James Webb, which offer us exceptional views of the Universe. The list of NASA's most outstanding missions is extensive. Today, NASA is once again targeting the Moon for longer manned missions, thanks to the installation of a permanent station around our natural satellite. It also has among its objectives to continue exploring the planet Mars, this time with manned missions.</p>
            <h1 class="titulo_1">¿Qué es la NASA?</h1>
            <p class="texto_1">NASA is the government agency that manages the U.S. space program. This organization was founded in 1958 and has been working ever since on the development of technologies and missions aimed at increasing our knowledge of space. Thanks to spacecraft, telescopes, manned missions, research and publications, NASA is today the most important organization in the conquest of space and its activities have worldwide repercussions in both scientific and technical fields.</p>

            <h1 class="titulo_1">What do the NASA acronyms stand for?</h1>
            <p class="texto_1">The name NASA is an acronym for "National Aeronautics and Space Administration". It means in English: "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", and this gives us an idea of its mission: NASA is the agency that organizes the main space research and exploration programs, and at the same time the one that conducts research in the field of aeronautics.</p>

                            <p class="description">It first appeared in 1959, when NASA's executive secretary asked James Modarelli, head of the Lewis Research Center's Reports Division, to create a logo that could be used for less formal purposes.</p>
                            <p class="description">What did Modarelli do? He simplified the official seal by removing the red letters National Aeronautics and Space Administration U.S.A. and adding the white letters NASA.</p>
                            <p class="description">But that was not all. He also eliminated the yellow sphere, leaving the white stars, the red V-shaped wing (a bit thicker and protruding) and the orbiting spaceship. All these elements appear on a blue sphere representing a planet.</p>
                            <p class="description">Thereafter, this insignia, better known as the "meatball," became NASA's primary logo; however, this changed in 1975.</p>
